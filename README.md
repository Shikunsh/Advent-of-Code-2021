# Advent-of-Code-2021
Practicing one liner Python or designing my own descriptor classes.

# Day 11
My first descriptor class yay! Only implemented \__get__ so that it is non-overriding and self-caching after first accesses.

# Day 13
Nothing interesting. I just wanted to avoid duplicate codes of folding in x and y directions, and avoid explicitly accessing x and y attributes all the time. Then I got tired at writing \__str__ method, which is full of ugly x and ys.
